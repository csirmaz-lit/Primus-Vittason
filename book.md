# The First Peak
# I Introduction


“We humans have an inquisitive mind,” Primus said, “and we want to understand everything. Our own existence is no exception. Yet facing the fundamental questions of our lives fills us with dread and terror, and we do everything to escape their beckoning.

“The road to a deeper understanding of life is like climbing a mountain: it is hard, but the reward is immense; for only by overcoming the roughest terrain can we find peace and our place in the world.”


It is strange, writing an introduction to something I have not been able to write about. Or, rather, write about properly, as I suspect all of my writing has been, in a way, about this question; actually, I am led to believe that this is what all writing, all art, and all human endeavor is ultimately about. It is not death; that is only part of the question that is easy to deal with; and it is not exactly the ultimate reason or meaning in life, because either no such thing exists, or it is biologically determined, which does not leave much for the imagination. Instead, it is more a question of the identity of something that exists; how that identity evolves in time, and how it interacts with other identities. The question of one's identity in the most abstract sense, or of the self, or the I, seems to me to encompass all questions about the reason for living, the reason to live, life after death, and, perhaps most importantly, before it.

It is of no surprise that I have not been able to write about this subject matter properly, as I think no one has. Contemplating it is a personal journey, as shown by the many competing and contradicting philosophies that from ancient times have grown out of our forlorn quest to squeeze a drop of meaning out of the barren randomness of our universe. I invite you to join me on this journey, as I have learned a lot on the road, and there is so much still to discover.


“The first stage of our journey is achieving the Experience,” Primus continued. “It is not easy, and it is not something that can be done once and then forgotten; reliving the Experience again and again is necessary throughout the journey as we uncover deeper and deeper layers of understanding. The Experience is like running: one can read about it, one can learn about it, but these are not substitutes for the action. We must strive to live the Experience, however hard it is at first. As with running, and so with the Experience, with time our technique is refined, and our takeaway from it changes, evolves and deepens.”


**This book is a work of fiction, including the descriptions of the Experience and of ways of achieving it. It is intended to be read as a personal account and a thought experiment by a fictional character. The effects of the Experience or of trying to achieve it on the human mind have not been investigated, let alone proven to be harmless. Therefore nothing in this book is to be taken as a suggestion to follow or attempt in real life.**

“I now want you to close your eyes. You are in a bathtub. You have turned off the tap a few minutes ago. There is silence around. And a voice inside says, ‘Oh, the water is getting cold. Why is the water getting cold? Just when I'm getting in. Same thing every day. Look at my toes. Same toes. Bit less pale, perhaps. Do I know these toes? Are they my toes? I guess it’d hurt if someone cut them off, so they must be. Then I have twenty toes. ‘Cause it’d hurt if someone cut off Jay’s toes. Twenty toes. Does Jay have twenty toes, too? And four eyes. But maybe he doesn’t want my eyes. They’re a bit crap.

“‘But that’s all I can see. Bit crap, but still OK to see the stairs. For a few years, and then that’s it, all darkness. Closed in all day into the darkness. I’ll still have my toes, though. And water. Damn it’s really cold now.’

Primus paused.

“You may now open your eyes, and we can continue. This was our first glimpse at the Experience. Achieving the Experience paves the way for a fuller, deeper understanding of the world. We can never fully explain the Experience in language, but we can try to get closer and closer to it. We can say, for example:

“‘The Experience is the feeling that there is only one being that is I. I question if there ever was, or ever will be, another I.’

“Or, ‘The Experience is solitude, it is to be alone.’

“‘The Experience is being trapped in my body.’

“‘The Experience is the terror I feel when confronted with the limits of existence.’

“‘The Experience is the realization that I am completely at odds with everything else in the world, past, present, or future; for nothing else is I; everything else is different.’

“In fact, let me stop here for a bit. You can already see a focus on the I: I am trapped, I am unique. Why unique? Because whatever is trapped inside my body, is unique to me—it is me. It marks a unique part of space for the body it is connected to. This body looks very similar to other human bodies, but that is not really true: it’s inherently different from all others because they are not me. In fact, it is (and I am) inherently different from everything else in the world, for everything else is not me, too.

“This separation of the I from the rest of the world is already there in Descartes, who could only assume the existence of the I, but not the existence of anything else.

“This difference between (the) I and everything else is vital and primeval. It gives rise to the Experience, and it is only after learning to experience and appreciate this difference that we can start to understand what the I can be. We call it the **Primeval Difference**.

“And so we can add to our statements about the Experience:

“‘The Experience is the contradiction between my body being precious and unique, as it is me; but at the same time similar to all other bodies.’

“And: ‘The Experience is the helplessness that I can be so easily destroyed, that my body is so fragile.’

“These sentences won’t make too much sense at this stage. We are at the beginning of exploring and understanding the Experience. As we progress on our journey, and talk about and practice achieving the Experience, return to these statements for inspiration. They will be gradually filled with meaning.”
# II Perception and the Mind

When we perceive something, we always do so on a physical level. Let us call this **material perception**. We see light, we hear sound, we smell small molecules, and so on. This is not a surprising statement, but it has wide-ranging consequences. One is that even though we say things like “I see you are happy,” we can never actually see the happiness, only someone who looks and sounds like someone who is happy. Therefore if someone (or something) can mimic being happy completely, we are forced to assume that it is indeed happy, as we will find nothing to contradict this assumption. It also means that ultimately, machines can become intelligent and can have emotions, as there is no inherent reason why they could not seem to be intelligent and have emotions.

This reasoning is related to the Turing test for intelligence, which simply says that a machine is intelligent if it is indistinguishable from a human. (The Turing test restricts “indistinguishable” to written communication so as not to task computers with having to look and sound like humans, although with modern advances in synthesizing voice and faces this may no longer be a problem.) In other words, it defined an intrinsic property, intelligence, based on whether the entity appears to be intelligent or not, very much in line with material perception.


# ***

When we observe something, it happens via our bodies. We see with our eyes, we hear with our ears, we touch with our skin. So it is not only true that observation is limited to the physical; it is also always mediated through our bodies.

There have been claims throughout history of other kinds of observations: clairvoyance, out-of-body experiences, and so on. None of these phenomena could be independently and scientifically verified, that is, in a way that can be repeated, and under controlled conditions. James Randi offered a large sum of money to anyone who can do so, but it has never been claimed.

# ***

There is the argument for dualism (which maintains that humans are not mere physical beings, but also have a divine spark or soul that enables them to think, talk, and be intelligent) which states that the physical brain is too simple to to give rise to the amazing range of human creativity that we see. This is simply wrong.

It is true that if you open a skull, you will not find Hamlet's monologue or a yearning for ice cream among the neurons. Each neuron is just too simple for that. But open a microchip or CPU instead. Will you find the video of the cat on your screen among the transistors? Clearly each transistor is way too simple to represent a cat. Yet we know it is there, because many transistors together can give rise to this representation. So why couldn't many neurons write Romeo and Juliet or be excited about lemon sorbet?

For our purposes, memory (a faculty to store experiences) is of special importance, as well as cognition (a faculty to compare and evaluate them). We know that physical damage to the brain can alter both faculties in humans. All of these make it logical to assume that the brain, a part of the human body, is doing the remembering and the thinking; that memories (and cognition) are encoded physically in the brain. That is, memory and cognition or functions of the body.

# ***

“I maintain,” Primus continued, “that the mind is simply the brain, which is made of the same kind of material as the rest of the human body. No one has ever discovered anything special in the brain that would make it different from the body, and no one has ever discovered anything special about what humans know or do that cannot be explained by the workings of the brain. Nothing special or extra is needed than the body to give rise to a mindful sentient being. We do not need metaphysical entities to account for the functions of the human mind, or the semblance of free will it produces.

“It is also easy to see that while our whole bodies defined us, thinking is localized in the body to the brain. We don't think - or at least not much - with our fingers in the same way as we don't digest with our knees or walk on our eyes.”

**“Do not subscribe to false and harmful tenets about souls that live separately from our bodies, or minds that transcend matter. Our bodies are us in every sense; make peace with them and guard them; yours as well as others’.”**

# ***

John Searle invented a thought experiment to show that no computer can ever be said to have a mind or be conscious. By extension, this assertion would contradict the suggestion above that the human mind is nothing but the product of a physical, mechanical brain, for the brain is also “only” a physical system that obeys known rules.

The thought experiment goes like this: suppose there is a person who does not speak **Chinese**, locked into a **room** with a big book of rules. They receive questions written in Chinese through a slot in the door. They then use pen and paper to follow the rules in the big book and produce some Chinese characters based on what they received. This turns out to be a response to the Chinese question in Chinese, which they post back through the slot. For someone outside the room, it seems they are having a conversation in Chinese, yet the person does not speak a word of Chinese.

Since the book clearly does not understand Chinese, and the person does not understand Chinese, they together don't understand Chinese, Searle says. And they are just like a computer with a program. So no computer will ever understand Chinese, even if they appear to do so.

But far from supporting this conclusion, the Chinese room is actually a very good argument for emergent qualities. Neither the person nor the book has an understanding of Chinese (the person doesn't know Chinese, and we normally don't think of books as having an understanding), yet their combination does, and together they function as a Chinese-speaking person with consciousness. Similarly, no single neuron in the human brain can speak a language or be conscious, yet these are true of the whole brain.

Searle's argument is said to apply to computers with programs only, but that is just another way of saying that as soon as you can separate a system into a processor and a program, or two piles of neurons, somehow it suddenly loses all claims to be conscious.

This is very much linked to how we define consciousness. The best we can do is to say that something is conscious if we think it is, or if it is like a human being, which we usually think is conscious. We refer back to Alan Turing again and his Turing test, which defines intelligence this way (something is intelligent if it behaves like a human being) - the equivalent may very well be the only definition we have of consciousness.

Also note that following from material perception, when we judge something to be conscious or not, we can only use information of that thing that reaches us - in the case of the Chinese room, the pieces of paper coming through the slot. We cannot see “inside” the thing to make our judgment.  Something is conscious if it appears to be conscious, just like we deem another person sad or happy if they appear sad or happy - we don't dissect their brain first to make sure they really are.

# ***

One of the main arguments against seeing the human mind as a physical system is **free will**. A physical system is seen as predictable, mechanic, whose future states can in theory be predicted from its initial one. How could such a system have free will?

There are many questions and problems bundled up in the above argument; I will need to restrict myself to just touching on them.

First of all, humans are largely predictable: psychology, psychiatry and sociology describe and predict our behavior very effectively. So maybe we have less of a free will anyway than we imagine.

Secondly, physical systems are only completely predictable in classical physics, and even there only in theory. For example, predicting the movements of three celestial bodies (just three, without anything else in this simple universe) using classical physics is already so complicated numerically, that it can only be predicted inaccurately and with very great effort.

In quantum mechanics, some randomness is creeping into the physical reality, which makes such predictions impossible even in theory. Indeed, some physicists, like Roger Penrose, find free will exactly here.

But on the most fundamental level, what would free will be? It would mean that a human, given some well-known conditions, can choose to act this way, or that way. To test whether the human indeed has this choice, and is not simply at the mercy of the chemical processes in its brain, we would need to recreate the initial conditions exactly many-many times, and observe if the human behaves the same way all the time, or its mind can shake off the shackles of some deterministic physics and somehow contradict it. This is the basis of all scientific knowledge: experiments.

The sad truth is that we never are (or will be) able to recreate the initial conditions exactly. If nothing else, time has changed: in our world, time appears to be monotone, moving forward all the time, and we can never jump back to a previous point to do a "what if" experiment. This means that we will never be able to determine if humans indeed possess free will or not.

Does this mean that all experiments are flawed? Yes, it does. But most systems that we experiment on are simple and robust enough, and they do not require a complete recreation of the initial conditions. If we release a cannon ball from the top of a tower, it will fall with roughly the same speed today, and tomorrow, if the sun shines, or if it rains. But free will precisely aims at determining whether there is any wiggle room in the laws of physics, and whether this can somehow be navigated or controlled. Such approximate experiments would not help us settle this question.

But time is not actually monotone! I hear you say. There is space-time, and one can move in time similarly to moving in space. Therefore it could be possible to recreate the initial state perfectly and test free will. It is indeed true that an almost forward flowing time is not inherent in most physical processes as they can happen forwards as well as backwards (with some extra conditions). Yet we do experience time as a separate, monotone thing, and how this kind of time emerges is the subject of active research. As far as I understand, the current theory is that due to how universes evolve, certain processes (that usually go forward in time) are simply more probable than processes that go backwards.

Ultimately though we don't have the final answer about time, while understanding its exact nature would be crucial in understanding an experiment, an initial state, a consequence, or something that goes against consequences: free will. We simply cannot decide at the moment if humans have free will, and if time is indeed monotone, the question itself becomes nonsensical.

# ***

“I find little promising about the notion of **qualia**. The fact that certain physical brain states are organized into experiences, abstract qualities (e.g. color) or feelings via introspection, and that these can be communicated via language (as without these being communicated and externalized we may as well assume they do not exist), is more a consequence of our shared biology and morphology than anything else. Humans are very similar in terms of their genetic makeup and environment, which in turn makes our gene expression, bodies, brains, learning, etc. very similar, too. We have also evolved to be pattern-seeking animals, so it is little wonder that we find patterns, and similar patterns, in our brain states. This in itself does not warrant ascribing any kind of reality to these patterns. In this sense, the problem we face here is very similar to the reality of objects in the face of the boundary problem, which we will introduce soon.”
# III Entrapment

We now know that when we perceive the world, it happens via our bodies, and these perceptions are also stored in a memory that is encoded in the body. These statements may sound trivial, but they have the important consequence that if we consider everything we have experienced, we necessarily find that each and every one of these experiences happened through the same body - our body.

In other words, we always, inevitably, feel to be inside in our bodies. We always see the world from our bodies: through our eyes, and from the point in the world where our bodies are. We always hear, smell, and touch the world from the very same point, and we affect the world by movement and voice from our bodies as well. We are trapped in our bodies. This is called **Entrapment**.

Is Entrapment really true? It must be, because it is a logical consequence of how perception, memory and cognition work. And we ignore supposed phenomena like mind reading, effect at a distance, out-of-body experiences, clairvoyance and other supernatural occurrences for the same reason as above.

# ***

“Entrapment is a facet of the Experience,” Primus said, gesticulating heavily in front of his audience, “but as elsewhere with the Experience, it is not only true that the whole implies the part, but also that the part, Entrapment, implies the whole Experience.

“Why is Entrapment of interest? Isn't it self-evident? In a sense, yes. But we tend to forget it. We tend to conveniently overlook how much we rely on our bodies in our existence; as we shall see, highlighting this fact has wide-ranging consequences.

“During our journey we will learn how to accept this fact, and how to reconcile ourselves with our bodies, which all the Western traditions have been teaching us to ignore.”

# ***

Next, let us dissect the definition of Entrapment above, with special focus on what is required for the emergence of this phenomenon or feeling.

First of all, notice that if Entrapment means that one is convinced that one always sees (and interacts with) the world from one's body, then it is equivalent to realizing that all previous interactions with the world happened via the same body as the current one. (Of course, strictly speaking, the body is not the same atom-by-atom as the one through which previous observations were made, but a sufficiently slow rate of change allows the mental faculty to keep identifying the physical body with its abstraction of it, and build a sense of permanence.)

We are making no assumptions about “who” is making the interactions or observations via the body. The above statement, although it may sound complicated, is really just making it explicit what “always” means: that whenever something occurred, it occurred in the same way.

This means that Entrapment requires (1) memory (for one needs to recall previous interactions), and (2) some level of cognition (as one needs to be able to compare how these interactions happened).

“Memory and cognition are therefore the prerequisites of Entrapment, and, by extension, of the Experience.”

It is illuminating to consider what or who can satisfy these requirements. Memory, surprisingly, can be quite universal -- even a piece of rock can be said to have a “memory” of things that happened to it (like chips missing or discoloration) as physical interactions will change its physical make-up. In fact, any physical interaction, by definition, will do so.

We may consider here, as a possible counter-example, completely reversible processes, which, once reversed, would leave the rock in its initial state. But it is very unlikely that this could occur, as it is unlikely that the atoms of a rock, once disturbed (or simply moving about) can ever return to the same positions.

With this kind of memory, it is clear that the information carrier that records the events is the rock itself; that memory is at the same point in space as the “body” of the rock. And we have already argued that human memory, in a similar fashion, is localized in the body, and in particular in the brain.

For completeness, it is important to clarify that it is not allowed for the memory to “remember” other interactions with the world that did not happen through the body, as then the feeling of Entrapment would not arise. On the one hand, this is consistent with regarding the memory as part of the body, for what else the body, a physical system would remember than the things that happened to it? On the other hand, creating fake memories where we experience something that happened to a different person (this being the main function of art according to Representism) is actually one of the ways in which one attempts to escape the feeling of Entrapment.

As Primus put it later, “To face Entrapment and give rise to the Experience, one must purge the mind of such fake memories.

“Of course, they are not fake in the sense that information about another person, say, in a story or movie, reaches us as part of some physical interaction like sound and light. But then we focus on this other person almost as on ourselves, and regards their experiences as our experiences, thereby effectively escaping the temporal and spatial limits of our bodies. I call this **dilution.** This is extremely helpful as we can acquire much more experience -- knowledge — as we could directly gather. And this is actually our main mode of existence. This is what we do when we read a novel, a magazine, a post from a friend, when we chat to someone.

“The flip side of this is that this mode masks our limits and the true nature of Entrapment. This is why we must step out of this mode to achieve the Experience.”

# ***

Let us move to cognition, more specifically, to the kind of cognition required for Entrapment. I do not believe we have a clear definition of what cognition is, or when we can say that something possesses it. The best we can do is, again, to fall back on a kind of Turing test, which in effect says that (a) humans have cognition, (b) something else has cognition if it is sufficiently similar to a human (in some way relevant for cognition, whatever that may be). But there is a catch.

We may generally like a definition of cognition that says that rocks do not think (and do not die when we turn them into countertops), but can we say for sure that crows, dogs or elephants do not reflect on their past experiences, or fear, or, however unlikely, think about death? What would make us absolutely certain that trees do not have some kind of cognitive powers, which may be the right ones to experience Entrapment? The problem with the Turing test-based definition of cognition is that once an object or organism is unable to communicate its thoughts or feelings to us humans, it is immediately rendered insufficiently human-like and fails the test. For how would we even have a glimpse of the existence of these thoughts if we receive no information of them? Dogs and trees may well contemplate death, but until we find a better way to communicate, we will never know.

And what is the location of cognition, at least the human one? We can use the same argument as above, namely, that an injury to the brain can affect one's cognitive abilities, so it is the brain, a part of the body, that must be doing the thinking.

# ***

Primus took a glance at his watch. He had time for a little detour.

“But what is trapped inside the body?” he paused for effect. “The notion of the soul comes immediately to mind, and with it innumerably more questions. Can the soul be somehow grasped or defined? What happens to it after the death of the body?

“One can imagine the body as the actor on stage, and the soul, or self, or I, and so on, to be the playwright speaking through it. Or the body as the character in a video game, and the soul the player controlling it. This view would marry well with the tenets of reincarnation or the idea that souls have an afterlife having left the body.

“But such a view seems to contradict experience and logic. Leaving one's body is at best uncommon, and at worst impossible -- again, it has never happened in a controlled environment. Taking control of another body also falls into this category.

“If so, we are forced to conclude that one soul is only attached to one body. How does it do that? What is the difference between human bodies that allows my soul to select my body? It appears fruitless to argue that some physical variation, like the DNA, accounts for this permanent link. This would of course fail in the case of identical twins. As we shall see, it is unclear where a body is, anyway, making such a link even more difficult to understand. And, in general, variations from person to person appear too small to control -- somehow -- something as fundamental as the identification of an external soul. It is, of course, no surprise that such arguments are doomed to fail, as they aim at explaining something supernatural in purely physical terms.

“So why are we trying to grasp the human soul on materialistic grounds here, when it is clearly impossible? Science, by the very way it accumulates knowledge, is only be able to know what is general, as it concerns itself with phenomena that are capable of being reproduced reliably and many times. Science, therefore, will never be able to account for individuality, which, perhaps, means that it cannot be expected to discover the physical difference between human bodies I referred to above. To this I would reply that I am more than willing to acknowledge the existence of meta-physical phenomena but only if the subject at hand cannot be satisfactorily explained within the materialistic framework. When Napoleon asked Laplace, ‘Where is God in your theory?’ he replied, ‘I don't need that hypothesis.’ Do we need it? Do we need the notion of the soul?

“Having considered memory and cognition in relation to Entrapment, and, separately, the mind, we see that these are all rooted in our physical bodies. And so, if memories are recorded in the body, then it is unnecessary and unlikely that they are duplicated in the soul; if thinking is done inside the body, then it is unnecessary and unlikely that any thinking is done in the soul.

“The soul has therefore become an empty shell; without memories and without a history it is devoid of an identity. Therefore even if there is a host of souls that animate our bodies, it would cause no difference which souls attached to which bodies -- they could even switch any time without any noticeable effect, as the memories they would see at any point would be from the pasts of the bodies, not from their own pasts.

“Souls are therefore not needed to create the sense of Entrapment: the brain is complicated enough to do so. We can go further, as based on the above, souls are actually superfluous complications, and history has taught us the principle of Occam's Razor, which dictates that unnecessary things seldom exist.”

Primus wiped the chalk powder on his hands into his trousers.

“Here we are only laying some—physicalist—groundwork,” he concluded the lecture, “but soon we will get to more interesting things, like glimpses at quantum mechanics and a new way of meditating over or considering existence.

“The journey is not always easy; nor is climbing a mountain, but the reward of seeing the world and our place in it comes after difficult work and acceptance.”
# IV Body and Care

There are no objects.

While this may sound somewhat surprising, it is in fact a simple observation. On the atomic or molecular level, nothing can tell us where one object ends and another one starts. The body, for example, is a collection of cells, which are collections of molecules, both held together not by chemical bonds but by secondary forces –- while at the same time, dirt, dust, creams, parasites stick to the skin using the same forces. Objects we hold do not fall to the ground because of friction between them and our skin – in other words, they, too, stick to the skin using secondary forces. So the thing these forces connect to us, is it another skin cell of us or is it a piece of Camembert? To highlight this problem from another angle, there is no way to tell whether a carbon atom around the surface of our skin belongs to us or to the cheese we are eating. We call this the **boundary problem**.

That is, objects are abstractions of collections of mass in the world that are somehow useful for the observer to consider as a single unit. A better version of the above statement therefore is:

Objects are subjective.

Our focus here is on the human body, and we can demonstrate its fuzziness by referring to the cellular, molecular and atomic levels. But it is worth noting that atoms and their constituent particles are also likely to be abstractions of even deeper levels of some physical reality, for example, the vibrating strings of String Theory.


# ***

The body is the physical system that we associate with ourselves. Entrapment also suggests that, for all intents and purposes, it is the instrument of perceptions, that is, we use the body to perceive and interact with the world.

But what is our place in the world? Where am I? How far do our bodies reach? These questions are more complicated than they seem because in reality, we do not know where exactly our bodies are.

While we have a fairly certain feeling about the place and the extension of the self and its body in the world in general, the application of the boundary problem to the body means that microscopically, there is no clear boundary between the human body and the outside world.

In a special sense, the boundary problem is the contradiction between the fairly certain human feeling about the place and the extension of the self and its body in the world, and the fact that microscopically, there cannot be a clear boundary.

To have a better grasp at the spatial limits of a body, let us consider bits of matter, or regions of space, that, if they change, have an effect on our mental state. Clearly, parts of the body connected to the brain via nerves fall into this category (a pinprick in one’s finger causes pain, for example) and so we should consider them part of the body. But it can also be argued that changes to one’s hair or nails (e.g. a bad hair cut, a lock cut during one’s sleep, a broken nail) can also affect one’s mental state (cause distress) if discovered via visual or tactile clues. Indeed, we generally consider these parts of the body as well.

But notice that objects traditionally regarded as separate from the body, for example, possessions, can function very similarly to nails and hair: just consider the distress caused if one discovers that someone scratched their car while they left it in the supermarket car park.

# ***

We have seen that the boundary between our body and the world is rather fuzzy, and that things outside our bodies function similarly to it in that we care about them. This is quite obvious in the case of possessions: our shirt is no more or less alive than our hair; we are similarly saddened if they do not look their best, yet one is traditionally regarded as part of the body, while the other is not.

One could argue that the hair is somehow permanently attached to the body while it remains easy to take off a shirt, but on closer inspection this difference looks less and less clear: hair cannot be permanently attached as it grows and is replaced and sometimes some fall out, and we have the boundary problem which makes it clear that the difference between their attachment is merely one of grade.

In a similar fashion, the concept of the body can be extended to other humans whom we care about -– for example, accidents to our family and loved ones affect us similarly to accidents to ourselves, while we are much less affected by events occurring to unknown people.

It therefore no longer seems very useful to talk about a hypothetical unified body; instead, we consider a collection of things, and say that we are defined by a fuzzy set of physical systems that affect our mental state if information about them reaches us. We will call this region of space our **Care**. Care may also include concepts and abstractions like nation and country, which shows that Care is a crucial component of one’s identity.

# ***

“Care, therefore,” Primus continued, “can link other humans to the self, which has a similar effect than incorporating experiences from others. That is, this is also dilution, just approached from a different angle: **dilution in Care.**

“One can argue that the more the self, via Care, extends to possessions and other people of interest, the more it protects itself from its demise, its death with the body, and the more bearable the tragedy of the Experience becomes.

“Consequently Care and interest needs to be temporarily withdrawn from others and possessions, and focus should primarily be on the original, very limited body itself for one to reach the Experience.”
# V Death

“Death, at first approximation, is the destruction of our bodies. As we have established that there is no need for a soul (and so it likely does not exist), and that faculties like memory and cognition are functions of the body, death means the destruction of the self.

“Note that here, we use ‘body’ in its original sense. In the case of one’s death, other objects, organisms or humans in one’s Care continue to function—while, arguably, the circle of Care itself ceases to exist.

“Incidentally,” Primus turned to the audience, “it has been suggested that we humans disproportionately fear non-existence after our deaths, but no one cares about non-existence before we are born. Do you know why that may be?” He paused, but nor for long. “I think it has to do with information. We seem to know about the world before our birth, but we’ll miss out on everything that comes after we die. So let’s get back to death.

“What does the destruction of the body mean? Most events leading to death are not extreme (high-energy) enough to, for example, change the atoms in our bodies; they may not even change the molecules. What they inevitably change instead is the physical arrangement of the elements or parts of the body, which leads to the loss of various functions (movement, speech, cognition, etc.). Among these are the ones that are prerequisites of the Experience, so once dead, we can no longer have the Experience.

“This change of arrangement that leads to a loss is similar to how information encoded in macroscopic systems can disappear apparently without a trace. We can burn books, destroy paintings and computers, and never be able to recreate the text, the picture, or the data. This won’t come as a surprise to anyone, but it seems at odds with the assertion in quantum mechanics that no (quantum) information can be lost.

“The likely explanation to this apparent contradiction is that a special macroscopic arrangement, used to encode some useful information, represents a very-very tiny amount of energy which is drowned out even by the energies of chemical processes. A fire converting the carbohydrates of a book into water and carbon dioxide doesn’t care much if the pages are filled with random letters or the text of Hamlet. It is likely true that burning a book of Hamlet will increase entropy more than burning a book with random letters, but this difference is likely to be very tiny. In other words, in the macroscopic word, we can store information virtually for free, but we can also easily lose it. And this is also true of life.

“That is, humans are information,” Primus concluded. “But at the moment we cannot download this information and store it in cloud computers to ask someone a question or let them see their children after they have died, so the best way to preserve this information is to let people to live.”

# ***

It is convenient to define death as the destruction of one’s body, while we have seen that the body is an ill-defined concept. We introduced Care to take its place, but it is also clear that most objects or entities in a circle of Care survive even if someone—a body—dies.

To be able to describe what we mean by death better, consider that different objects (note that objects themselves are subjective abstractions over material reality) that belong to a circle of Care as information emanating from them change the mental state of the “self” do so to different degrees. Arguably everything is included in the Care, as all changes can be said to affect us to some degree, while it is also clear that e.g. this link between our finger and us is much more immediate than, say, between us and an unknown person.

If so, we can attempt to define the other extreme of Care—here, instead of extending the original body, restricting it to a region of space or set of objects that are linked very closely to the self. We name this the **Agent**.

We can then redefine death as the destruction of an Agent. It may be that the Agent** **does not include the whole body, or even the whole brain—we can consider someone to survive an amputation or a stroke affecting part of their brain. Conversely, we can mourn the loss of a person even if parts of their bodies, technically, survive.

As we shall see, the concept of the Agent turns out to be very helpful in our further investigations.

“Humans may be unique in the fact that they are aware of their own death. Is the fact that I know I am going to die necessary to achieve the Experience?

“Let’s clarify,” Primus continued, “that nyyo one actually knows that they are going to die. We merely assume, based on our similarity to other people, that we are also going to die, and with largely the same consequences. If one either rejects this assumption of similarity (I am superman - everyone else dies but this does not apply to me), or rejects that the outside world actually exists (people appear to have died, but this may not be real or true) then one can also assume that they will not die.

“Of course, if one assumes that one will continue to exist infinitely (and without aging and ailments), it is easier to sidestep the problems posed by the Experience as even if one is limited in space (as the body is not infinite, and so one only has a narrow perspective of the world), one has all the time to compensate for this limitation. (Here we presuppose traditional space and time.) In other words, even if one experiences Entrapment, it can be seen much less of a problem; even if one is unique, it is much less frightening.

“In this sense, being aware of death certainly makes dealing with the Experience more urgent.

“Still, even without awareness of death, many aspects of the Experience continue to hold true. One is still limited to one’s body, so Entrapment is there; one is still different from everything else, so so is the Primeval Difference, and one can still see onself as unique. And it is likely still true that one’s body, and together with it, one oneself can be destroyed with relative ease.

“Overall, an entity that has the expectation to exist indefinitely may find it less important to consider different facets of the Experience, but it is still affected by them. Death is therefore not required for the Experience.”

**“Entrapment means that the self is limited in space; birth and death mean that it is limited in time.”**

# ***

Primus started the next session in a happy mood. “I have said that humans are information. But if so, what happens to this information after death?

“Clearly, with the disintegration of the system that is the I or self, the I as a generator of information ceases to function. However, in a sense, the information it expressed continues to function—its verbal messages are translated, reinterpreted, and through these processes it in effect continues to participate in various dialogs. Is Plato dead when he argues in the head of a student reading The Republic for the first time? Is Shakespeare dead on stage? It seems any information continues to function as long as it exists, which entails that physically, it escapes destruction, and a manuscript, a recording, portrait, sculpture, painting or image survives. Pharaohs had their deeds recorded in hieroglyphs carved in stone apparently to make sure the text survives for eternity. Nowadays one can leave an electronic trail of information on the Internet and on various social networks. These trails can become our pyramids, as long as they are not forgotten, or simply deleted.”

**“Praise librarians, praise archaeologists, praise historians - they sacrifice their lives to preserve that which would be lost forever.”**

“It is worth considering that there is a very narrow channel of information through which we get to know another person: sight, hearing, touch, but perhaps most importantly, verbal communication. This is in line with the tenet of material perception. If so, much of this information, especially verbal communication, can be deferred—for example, when reading some writing—, and can also be deferred beyond the person's death. Such communication can continue to influence and so in some sense, for other people, the person continues to function almost as if alive.

“Have you read a book and then only learned afterwards that its author has died a few years back? Did it matter?

“Sadly, being not dead in the eyes of others is not a substitute for the Experience, the state of us experiencing ourselves. We feel that this would be lost even though we understand that after our deaths there will not be anything to experience the cessation of the I. We can distract ourselves from this dread by focusing on Others, and be diluted by and into this focus, but this may offer temporary relief only, and will prevent us from learning from facing our fear.”

While in our everyday lives most things obey classical physics, it is now well understood that it is just an approximation of physical processes that are relatively slow and low energy. Quantum processes are still there, but we usually don't need them to explain things, just as we don't need an interferometer to bake a cake.

Yet Quantum Mechanics poses basic questions about our reality. One famous interpretation of why everything behaves like a wave and can be in multiple places and states at once until we look at it when it “collapses,” is Everett's many-world theorem, which basically states that this collapse is merely apparent as everything can be in multiple states and places at once, but since it includes us, we only see one of the possibilities. That is, there are many parallel worlds, and they somehow contain all possibilities and configurations.

This idea has inspired many novels and movies that use alternative realities in their plots, and one cannot help but wonder if one could cheat death this way, as even if we die in one world, surely it’s possible that we continue to exist, and so there will be an alternative world where all is still well.

Sadly the latest research into Quantum Mechanics and how it gives rise to the classical world seems to suggest that this is not so.

No, it is not the case that the collapse is a real thing induced by something with a consciousness looking at the world (approximately the Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum Mechanics) - as expected, since consciousness is not something that is a special physical thing.

Instead, quantum Darwinism suggests that non-classical configurations that are permissible in Quantum Mechanics (like a football being in a superposition of being in two different places) very quickly deteriorate into stable states (which happen to be permissible classical states) when they interact with the myriad of particles that surround us. So it is not really someone looking at (measuring) a system that causes it to collapse into a normal, classical state, but its interacting with a big environment. In a sense, the environment keeps measuring everything which forces everything into becoming classical.

This is true of large collections of particles, which includes the human body. So it seems likely that although we may need to invoke Quantum Mechanics to explain some processes, like how signals in neurons are transmitted, large, macroscopic properties of our bodies, like our position, or basically whether we still function or are dead, are describable with classical physics.

One can also argue that even if we continue to exist in an alternative world, a version of us does cease to exist with death, which is an existential threat in itself, especially since no one has demonstrated the ability to communicate with alternative realities, so for all intents and purposes our only accessible version dies.

A set of unsolved problems in modern physics is regarding “the arrow of time.” On the one hand, physical processes can happen both forwards and backwards in time (with some extra bits, see CPT symmetry): if a ball falls down, it speeds up; if someone throws it upwards, it slows down at the same rate. On the other hand, there are processes that we only regularly see happening in one direction, like a mug falling from the table and breaking into pieces.

Traditionally, entropy is cited as the reason why such processes do not happen backwards, as entropy should always increase; things should always become more chaotic. But this is not a hard law: entropy can be decreased with energy, and processes may happen backwards, just with much smaller probability. For example, if we shoot the pieces of the mug towards each other, and ensure that the atoms inside are just at the right place, they may re-form their bonds and we may just be able to recreate the mug itself. It's just quite unlikely.

Moreover, as e.g. Penrose points out, entropy can only increase if we originally started from a low entropy state. The Big Bang may have been such a state, but problems with this view of time do not stop here.

As I understand the state of the art theory about why time is moving forwards is related to sub-universes (bubbles with special physical constants inside) expanding and the flows generated by this process.

Now, if time is such an uncertain thing, and basically things are likely to move forward in time, but could move backward as well, just much less likely, do we still need to reckon with the end of our existence? Here, as elsewhere, I argue that without a way to cheat death using loopholes opened by modern physics, we need to, we can, and we should consider our existence in terms of classical physics, as our bodies are macroscopic. And for all intents and purposes, we live in a world with a monotone time, and our existence is limited both in space and time.

It is interesting and important to consider if our existence is determined by some quantum process, like alternative universes or reversing time to before our deaths, but such attempts can look like grasping at straws. Arguably since our bodies are macroscopic, we should be able to use classical physics to describe our existence, death, experiences etc. highly accurately. If it paints an unfavorable picture of our existence,  it may be better to learn to accept it than to try to find loopholes in Quantum Mechanics.

# VI Difference and Uniqueness

“The observations we have described so far are objective truths that apply generally, to all selves and all I’s. They do not explain or describe the subjective experience of being locked into one’s body (Entrapment), of being limited in space and time in an apparently random manner (Why was I born in this place at this time?), of being **Different** from the external world (as everything else is not me), and of being **Unique** (as there is only one me).

“If we model our world as some physical reality with a number of thinking Agents, and we look at such a world from the outside,  we see that all Agents will experience Entrapment as long as they are physical systems. This is because then all their memories are encoded physically as well, and we can follow the argument we have made before about comparing previous memories to the current perception of the world and realizing that perception always happens from the same body. However, nothing explains or illuminates why one of these Agents appear to be **Selected** to be ‘I’.

“We can look at the consequences of the same argument in different ways. One way is to say that whichever Agent is Selected, it will think that it has always been Selected since it experiences itself as a continuously existing entity with a permanence to its identity. That is, if this body is I, it has always been I, since it was the I during a previous experience the memory of which is encoded in the same body.

“Another way is to say that even if Selectedness somehow migrates from one Agent to another, all information an Agent has access to from the past is still the memories encoded in its body. No information transfer happens with the migration, and so even if this migration is happening, no Agent can detect it. Note that this is the same argument that we used to hollow out and ultimately discard the notion of the soul. Indeed the role of the soul we scrutinized, which was to identify people, and the role of Selectedness, which identifies ‘I’, is the same, and neither can be linked to anything in physical reality.

“Selectedness therefore has some strange behavior. It seems to be there, but where, or whether it moves, cannot be detected. This can be explained if we say that Selectedness is not an objective, but a subjective phenomenon. Someone said that as soon as we try to look at consciousness, it seems to disappear. The same thing is happening here.

“Note that we are assuming that only a single Agent is Selected. This tallies with our subjective experience and with Uniqueness, and mirrors our implicit assumptions that Entrapment is into a single body, and Care is centered around a single Agent. That said, we appear to be describing a subjective—psychological—experience of identity, and in theory we could leave open the possibility of multiple Agents developing a common identity. After all, why couldn’t I somehow think that I and George are one person? Can the notion of group identity grasped this way? Can an identity somehow survive the death of an Agent if it is linked to more? These are important questions, but for now we will disregard this potential complexity of identity.

# ***

“The **clone argument** yields similar results. It basically says that creating an equivalent copy of a body (and Agent) does not change the Selected status of the copied Agent, and since the original and copy Agents are physically equivalent, Selectedness cannot be a physical property.

“The argument runs like this: a body or Agent being copied does not experience an interruption in its existence, so its Selectedness cannot be altered by the procedure. If it was Selected, it continues to be so, which also entails that the clone cannot be Selected. In other words, if I am cloned, my clone will not be me. Finally, since the physical makeup of the original Agent and the clone are the same, Selectedness cannot depend on any physical information in a body. The information whether a body is Selected is external to its physical information—in fact, it depends on who the observer is.

“There are many assumptions rolled into this one argument. To begin with, due to Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle, it is not possible to measure atoms in the body to be cloned completely accurately. Moreover, particles in the original body are disturbed by the act of measurement, which we ignore when we say that Selectedness cannot be taken away from the original body by cloning. Also, the original body and the clone will necessarily occupy a different region of space—or time—, and so, in theory, they are distinguishable and necessarily different to some degree.

“Still, as we argued elsewhere, it is unlikely that a body cannot be cloned accurately enough to expect Selectedness to apply to both the original and the clone; in other words, we expect that something as fundamental as Selectedness does not depend on minute variations on the quantum level. This suggestion is supported by the observation that in time, particles in a body undergo many-many changes, yet the body (both or own as others’) is perceived to survive and be largely equivalent to its previous versions.

“Note that the argument presented here is simply the previous argument, in new guise, against the possibility of a soul latching onto a body based on the fact that bodies lack some physical *differentia specifica* that would allow a soul to select a body or Agent. (The boundary problem adds to the difficulty of finding such a link.) If we regard the soul as the vehicle which confers identity to a body, that is, if my soul Selects my body, we see how the two arguments are identical.””


# ***

“But, almost defying physical reality, we could take the clone argument to its extreme, and suppose that two, perfectly identical bodies exist at the same time and same place. Now we ask, is it possible for a mind or consciousness encoded in or implemented by one body to assert that it is not the other one?

“Since all possible observations this consciousness or Agent can make is the same for both bodies, there is no way for it to do so. That is, it could identify either body as itself.

“This is a crucial point here. Objects, bodies and their identification are not objective phenomena, but are human (or, in an attempt to be more general, mental or psychological) constructs. In other words, it is the Agent that learns or decides which body it is in. Admittedly, objectivity creeps in here as mostly inevitably an Agent will learn to identify itself with the body it is implemented by, so this identification is predictable by an external observer, which lends this process some objective reality or constraints. But this identification is not wholly inevitable: one can imagine contrived examples where an Agent (brain) implemented by one physical system is tricked to experience the world from a different body. Indeed such ideas often surface in sci-fi as they undermine the normal sense of identity, with uncanny results.

“Pushing the notion of learnt self-identification to the fore can help us overcome some of the difficulties posed by the boundary problem. Although the two descriptions are logically equivalent, it is more fruitful to think that **an Agent is learning not what it is in the physical world, but what it is not:** first, objectively existing things that are outside my control, and second, other Agents or entities that are on the same level as me, and have the same claim to existence as myself. Reaching this second stage is actually the second stage of our journey, beyond the Experience.

“As the Agent learns what bits of physical reality it is not, it no longer needs to answer the question ‘Which body am I?’—and so we no longer need to define what bodies are, which, as the boundary problem shows, start who-knows-where, end who-knows-where, and are separated by who-knows-what. Instead, the Agent gradually learns to identify itself to different degrees with various regions and entities in space, effectively mapping its physical core, the physical Agent, through the fuzzy body and finally its region of Care.

“Notice that his negative learning appears to match well with theories about how babies experience the world, from initially thinking that they have control over everything—that is, that they are everything—to realizing that some objects behave (apparently) independently and follow their own rules. To these, we usually learn to attribute objective existence.

“Also notice how this psychological model of self-identification solves some paradoxes around clones: if something is perceptibly different from what I habitually associates myself with, I will say it is not me, and the is true of perfect clones placed at a distance. I won’t see them as me, which is what we expect. But this does not hold for a clone at exactly the same place as me, as I won’t know which body I experience or am looking at.

We need to avoid avoiding the Experience
# The Second Peak
# Others

“We have crossed the gorge of non-existence,” Primus said, “stared into the abyss of nothingness, faced our fears of death and not-being-born, and ascended, one aching step after another, the cliff of the Experience.” He paused. “What have we done? We have learnt to focus on our existence, and we have realized its fragility. We have learnt how to reject the dilution of the everyday, to pull ourselves back to the Primeval, and face and learn our place in the world. We are more than the constantly diluted, but we are less because we laid ourselves bare in front of the possibility of not being there. We are richer of the Experience, but poorer because we put down the noise. Henceforth the Experience will always be there: we can call it, and it will call; it focuses us on what ultimately matters, and as a constant memento guides us to more meaning. But it is a force on its own: it brings dread and maims unless we grow strong to control it and bend it to our will. In short, we reached the first peak on our journey, and from this summit we see the strange landscape that lies ahead.

“What next? We have a choice to make. So far, we have focused on the call of our own Experience. Now we need to decide if Others have the same.”


# ***

It was always my hope that by attaining the Experience and learning about the fragility of existence, people would start valuing life as something to cherish and preserve, and avoid killing, maiming and hurting other humans as well as other organisms and structures, from books to planets. In short, I was hoping that the Experience would teach empathy. But there is a way it can all go wrong.

The Experience is frightening. It is a reminder of non-existence, of death, but, to be specific, it is a reminder of my death. It will likely lead to one valuing life more, but first it will make one value one’s own life. There is nothing in what we established so far that would force someone to think that others, other humans and maybe other entities can have the Experience as well, making them equivalent to us, and, most importantly, making their claim to existence the same as ours.

The Experience is a force, for good and ill. It can lead to goodness and a more meaningful life if it is paired with empathy, but that empathy likely needs to have existed beforehand. The Experience itself will not generate empathy, and without it, it may make a self-centered egoistical world view entrenched, and could even be used to justify violence in order to protect one’s vulnerable existence.

The second part of the Journey therefore is the acceptance of the belief that other Agents also exist in the world, who can also have the Experience, who are therefore at the same level as me and who are not in any way less valuable than myself. In short, we make the conscious decision to reject Solipsism.


# ***



#

The first stage of our journey is achieving the Experience. It is not easy, but is not something that can be done once and then forgotten; reliving the Experience again and again is necessary throughout the journey as we uncover deeper and deeper layers of understanding. The Experience is like running: one can read about it, one can learn about it, but these are not substitutes for the action. We must strive to live the Experience, however hard it is at first. As with running, and so with the Experience, with time our technique is refined, and our takeaway from it changes, evolves and deepens.



The Experience comes as a huge, overwhelming wave: sometimes unannounced, sometimes after invitation. To invite it, you must prepare, remove all distractions and focus on yourself and yourself alone.


Every living thing is unique, is dependent upon itself, and has the same fragile experience as you. Preserve it for it is irreplaceable and has no less right to exist than yourself.

Every complex structure in this universe carries valuable information that can be destroyed without trace. Aim to preserve as much as you can, from humans to books and galaxies.

There's only one of you. There's only one of them.

In modern life, our relationship with ourselves, and therefore with others, has become unhealthy. We need to tear down these relationships and rebuild them from the ground up.

I believe the differences between human beings are less significant than we like to think. Certainly, if one is capable of the Experience, all of them are.

The fundamental tragedy of our world is that information, unlike energy, can be lost.



After this brush with losing control of my body, I saw much more clearly how we have lost connection with our own existence, and that I can do something about it.

The result is this book.
