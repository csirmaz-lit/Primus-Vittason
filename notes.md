# How Do You Live?

### (Discover/Find) The meaning of life and a more honest existence in our modern world

## Body and Care

Clones

## Death


<a name="313">313)</a> Note on <a href="#308">#308</a>: conversion laws
appear to have their limits of applicability.  Conversion of mass applies
until we deal with high enough energies where energy and mass convert to
each other.  Conversion of atoms apply in chemical processes, but not in
nuclear processes.  Conversion of protons and neutrons apply in nuclear
processes, but not at energy levels where they can separate into quarks.

<a name="314">314)</a> If so, conversion of quantum information may be an
/approximation as well that is true at the energy levels we can currently
consider.  So despite <a href="#307">#307</a>, quantum information may
ultimately be lost, too.  (What does the theory say about the Big Bang? 
Black holes where this was a central issue?)

<a name="315">315)</a> Of course, quantum and other effects can happen at lower energies as well (tunneling) but are very unlikely.

## Difference and Uniqueness


<a name="412">412)</a> Further to <a href="#406">#406</a>, we expect that
every physical thinking agent will experience Entrapment, and so (as a
consequence) will also experience Selectedness - it will see itself as
different and unique.  But why?

<a name="414">414)</a> This would mean that the feelings of being different
and unique are neither different, nor unique to us.

# <a name="407">407)</a> Someone said as soon as we try to look at
# consciousness (<a
# href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJG1p_JyKsE">mentioned here</a>), it
# seems to disappear.  The same seems to be happening here.

<a name="408">408)</a> We could suppose that Selectedness is an objective
property, creating a kind of solipsistic world view.




<a name="409">409)</a> **Uniqueness** from <a href="#400">#400</a>: one may
have a sense of uniqueness, but it is not a requirement.  If there was an
exact copy of me placed in some controlled environment that is identical to
mine (so that we would evolve in the same way), my sense of self, dread of
death, etc.  would not change.

<a name="411">411)</a> We need to see if <a href="#409">#409</a> applies to
the copy of the self that may be another quantum state of it - see the many
world interpretation.  Note however that the environments of the two states
will be different.  See <a href="#311">#311</a>

<a name="413">413)</a> I may be **different** because I have direct access
to my own memories, but only indirect access to someone else's memories. 
This is an approximation.

<a name="415">415)</a> We can imagine a world without us (before we were
born; after we die) which raises the question why isn't the world *always*
without me.  Of course someone needs to pose this very question (I think
therefore I am by Descartes).

## Surviving

<a name="500">500)</a> Will lifting things into our care that do not die
with our bodies actually make us survive?  Removing the focus from the self,
focusing on something, especially if it's in our Care, distracts from
Entrapment and the Experience.  We may call this **Dilution**.  However, if
death is the cessation of the Agent, it does not make us survive death.

## Attitude to life

<a name="1003">1003)</a> Carnap is right that metaphysics is an expression
of an attitude to life rather than verifiable statements or arguments.  (The
Elimination of Metaphysics...  by Rudolf Carnap)

<a name="1004">1004)</a> The previous sections conatin investigations,
statements, arguments; this section contains expressions which may be best
communicated via some art form.

### The Experience

<a name="1000">1000)</a> We can provide tools / strategies for anyone to
have the Experience.  It can be a building block to a better attitude to
others and life.  However, it can also be a lonely and frightening
experience (a trial).  Maybe do it with support, in a community.

### Others

<a name="1001">1001)</a> We can either deny that other people can have the
Experience.  We consciously choose the latter.  This leads to the
recognition that life should be preserved; how important and unique every
life (indeed every structure) is.

<a name="1002">1002)</a> Our aim is to build empathy.

## Why-I


<a name="9002">9002)</a> This, however, is not a genetic description; it
does not explain why in the current world, I occupy this position, while
apparently the world is happy to exist without such a special entity (before
I's birth and after its death).





In other words, the universe one finds themselves in is not just (W), but
(W, B_x), that is, the body B_x is also put into a special position. 
There's nothing wrong with this: W in itself is highly random: why this
universe?  why now?  Adding B_x simply adds extra information that needs to
be provided before existence.

That is, X's Universe is U_x = (W, B_x) and Y's Universe is U_y = (W, B_y). 
We use the same W because we assume the existence of objective reality.

The sleight of hand of science is that it tricks us into thinking that we
only look at W, that is, U_x = (W) = U_y.

<a name="9004">9004)</a> My special position is not a property of the world;
it is a property of the world-according-to-me.

<a name="9005">9005)</a> I is a consciousness embedded in the world.

<a name="9006">9006)</a> From the point of view of an external
consciousness, the world exists, then develops some consciousnesses, which
then stop to exist.

<a name="9007">9007)</a> In a sense, we talk about logical statements with a
speaker which talk about the world from their point of view.  So "b_A:
I(b_A)" is true, but "b_B: I(b_A)" is false.  Probably though "I()" is the
only expression whose truth value depends on the speaker (assuming a common
objective reality).

<a name="9008">9008)</a> The identity of the observer limits the observable
part of the universe: which universe (if there are many), the event horizon
due to expansion, in time (if that is meaningful), but also in more subtle
ways: geography, resources, personal freedoms, etc.  So how common is the
supposed objective reality between observers?

<a name="9009">9009)</a> Still no notion of how this specialized situation (the I) emerges.

## Day 2

<a name="8000">8000)</a> There is a universe with entities (bodies) in it;
each entity can make statements.  Entity B_x can say that B_x is "I", that
is, "B_x :: I(B_x)" while "B_x :: I(B_y)" would be false wherever x != y. 
This of course is just equivalent to an identity operation "B_x :: I(B_y)
<=> I'(B_x, B_y) <=> B_x = B_y".

<a name="8002">8002)</a> Notice that all these problems go away if we have a
solipsistic approach.  If there is no objectively existing universe that
exists before and after the I, if there are no alternative bodies that may
just as well be "I" as my body, then there is nothing to explain.



## Day 3

% <a name="7000">7000)</a> The body contains the memories. The body contains cognition.
% <a name="7001">7001)</a> The brain is physical

<a name="7002">7002)</a> <a href="#7001">#7001</a> -> We experience the world in consistent() time and space steps.

% <a name="7003">7003)</a> We remember the same body

<a name="7004">7004)</a> <a href="#7003">#7003</a> -> We experience our body and learn that it belongs to us.

<a name="7005">7005)</a> <a href="#7004">#7004</a>, <a href="#7002">#7002</a> -> Entrapment

<a name="7006">7006)</a> The body / the region of Care / physical identity is fuzzy. In fact, all objects are fuzzy.

<a name="7007">7007)</a> <a href="#7005">#7005</a> -> Any localised brain
(with memory) can experience Entrapment.  <a href="#7004">#7004</a> and <a
href="#7002">#7002</a> are sufficient conditions.

<a name="7011">7011)</a> <a href="#7007">#7007</a> is a **general** statement (no statement on the special status)

<a name="7008">7008)</a> In fact, no (experienced) body is required for
Entrapment (that would be through <a href="#7004">#7004</a>), as <a
href="#7002">#7002</a> is enough to cause Entrapment.

<a name="7009">7009)</a> Experiences from others (art, communication) overcomes localisation in <a href="#7002">#7002</a>. They **generalise** the self.

<a name="7010">7010)</a> Possible experiment: simulated localised brain that
experiences the world locally with small movements in time and space, VS
simulated generalised / dislocated brain that can experience the world at
any time or place.  How do they learn to behave?

<a name="7100">7100)</a> Solipsism here means (a) (time) the World doesn't
exist outside the time when I exist; AND (b) (space) my brain is the only
brain.

<a name="7101">7101)</a> One brain: <a href="#7100">#7100</a> If so, (space)
no other brain is really a brain, so it is necessary the I am the only
existing brain / the only brain is the only one that has IX.

<a name="7102">7102)</a> Related terms: consciousness, sapience

<a name="7103">7103)</a> The anthropic principle and related arguments are likely relevant here. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle

<a name="7104">7104)</a> If there is one universe: It is unlikely to support
life, so why does it?  But our existence, however unlikely, is true, it is
an assumption/precondition/fact/truth - it doesn't matter how unlikely it
is.

<a name="7105">7105)</a> Multiverse / multiple universes: A universe is unlikely to support life, but there are many, so some will.

<a name="7106">7106)</a> <a href="#7105">#7105</a> Does not answer the question why I/we live in this universe.

<a name="7107">7107)</a> I exist (or just think?) (Descartes) -> there must be at least one brain -> this universe must support life.

<a name="7108">7108)</a> The starting point of <a href="#7107">#7107</a> is
an inevitable fact/truth.  We can only make statements about the current
world that are consistent with this.

<a name="7109">7109)</a> Although I can imagine a world in which I don't
exist and make statements about it.

<a name="7110">7110)</a> I cannot exprience a world in which I don't exist.

<a name="7111">7111)</a> Negation of solipsism <a href="#7100">#7100</a> is
EITHER: (time) the world exists when I do not exist (with or without other
brains); OR (space) there are many / other brains.

<a name="7112">7112)</a> <a href="#7111">#7111</a> (time) entails an objective universe / world.

<a name="7113">7113)</a> <a href="#7111">#7111</a> (time): the world exists when I do not exist -> I can not exist -> Why do I exist (now)?

<a name="7114">7114)</a> <a href="#7111">#7111</a> (space): there are many brains -> I could have been another brain -> Why do I have this identity / body?

<a name="7115">7115)</a> <a href="#7105">#7105</a> is an attempt to create a
probability for an event (life), and make its occurrence a possibility by
positing the existence of many trials (related to the law of large numbers). 
We can try the same with either <a href="#7113">#7113</a> or <a
href="#7114">#7114</a>.

<a name="7116">7116)</a> We know that once I exist as a physical system, I
will always feel entrapped into that system.  So all we need to ensure is my
existence; the rest follows.

<a name="7117">7117)</a> Is my existence an event that occurs?

7200) **If** we can define conscious / sentient / general life, then having life is an objective property of a universe.

7201) #7200 If not, then really the only measure of whether a universe has (conscious/sentient) life is whether I exist in it.

7202) If #7200, we can state whether a universe I do not exist in has (sentient, conscious, intelligent) life or not. If #7201, this is not possible.

## Day 4

7300) How do we determine if I exist in a universe?

7301) Bodies are constructs.  Objects are also constructs.  How do we
determine if a table exists in a universe?  E.g.  there are structures most
observers would say are tables.  This can be an objective statement.

7302) In the case of "I", the observer and the observed are the same.

7303) How do we determine if Alice or Bob exists in a universe?

7304) Experiment: does it matter whether receptors are part of the body, or if they are external and see the body in the same way as other bodies?

7305) #7303 We could say that just like with the table, it depends on what other observers say. Not sure if this is satisfactory.

## Day 5

Different universes could be just different places. Although unclear if parallel existence of the same body may only be allowed in different universes.

Bodies are constructs. (Parts in space like cognition, memory, receptors, output, possessions)

Body is defined by a universe, and a series of time-space pairs.

"I exist" is a truism (perhaps tautology?) because I can only make this utterance if I exist. (Descartes, no need for the other half.) What is the "I"?

So, collect where/when the body has self-identified / and when this is stored in its memory. (Memory is physical and local.)

There are no outside brains.

Perhaps: if solipsism is rejected, any statement about the I is true of any
other brain.  If so, it is never possible to grasp the special status of the
I - it is not an objective property of the universe.

Rejecting solipsism (in the sense of equivalence of brains) is asserting that there is no objective I.

Model: bodies are a network of components with printers that output statements.

Simpler model: properly separated agents

## Day 6

There are no external minds. There is no world without "I". If there is a statement, there is an embedded mind. This is the "I".
